Suppose you have a friend who asks to borrow some money. Most likely, 
unless you got trust issues or you're just heartless,
you'd probably help them out. You have faith that they'll pay you back eventually.

This *trust* you put in others to repay borrowed money is the notion of
**credit**. 

Now suppose the person asking you is really unreliable and loves to recklessly gamble it.
Let's call this definitely fictional character Ardelle[^0]. 
Well, you probably won't lend Ardelle your money because you know that you'll most likely never see that money agin.

## Credit Score
To help determine who we want to lend money to, let's come up with a system to score how much faith and trust we place in someone
to repay us. Let's refer to this as a **credit score**. If someone is reliable and has a good track 
record, let's say they have a high credit score. And Ardelle, well, she has a shit credit score.

If someone has a good credit score, you'd feel pretty comfortable lending money to them.

Now what do we do about the trash credit score friends? Apart from the obvious answer
of find better friends, you probably wouldn't lend them any money at all, and if you did, you'd keep
keep it minimal and probably ask for payment soon since it's riskier.

## The Mental Model
Despite the simplicity of the scenario, it provides a surprisingly accurate framework
for understanding the core fundamentals of debt, credit, and investing.

- **Core Idea 1**: Credit is the idea that we lend money to others with a degree of trust that they will repay us
- **Core Idea 2**: A credit score is the way we measure how likely someone will pay back their debt -- A measure of risk.
- **Core Idea 3**: Don't give money to Ardelle

In a future blog post, we'll go over the concept of interest, and look into
the importance of having a good credit score.

[^0]: I'm joking Ardelle if you're reading this, but for real, this is what you get for using a debit card all those years and refusing to get a credit card to build up your credit score.
