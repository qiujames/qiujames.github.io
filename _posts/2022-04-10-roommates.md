For those of you that know me personally, you should know that
I take great care to keep my personal space clean.

On the other hand, I live with four other guys in the same apartment.
Five guys in college living together does not result in a clean apartment.
When the apartment you live in is large enough to house five people,
it also becomes the perfect place for both the pregame and postgame.
Sometimes, you wake up in the morning to this unholy sight:

{% include gallery id="dirty-gallery" %}

And when you're the neat freak of the apartment, you can't stand
seeing your living space in that condition. So you can find yourself
spending more than a couple of hours cleaning.

{% include gallery id="clean-gallery"
caption="The clean apartment state you see above lasted for less than a day.<br>
We had another party the very next day..." %}

On paper, I should *hate* living with them.
My roommates and I are opposites in many ways.
I prefer keeping the environment quiet and calm. My roommates enjoy
blasting karaoke throughout the apartment regardless of the day or hour
(even at 1am during finals week).
I prefer to chill out or study quietly in my room.
My roommates like going out to bars, clubs, and raves (weekdays included).
I like keeping things extremely clean.
My roommates... well, you saw the pictures.[^1]

Surprisingly, deciding to room with the four of them
has been my best decision in college.
If didn't room with them, I would be living life exactly how I would want to.
The apartment would be squeaky clean with everything organized properly.
There would be no huge party with excessive alcohol to clean up after.
I'd have a cozy and quiet place to myself
and things would have been pretty terrible.

Yes you read that right. Things would have been terrible.

## The Comfort Zone Trap

Living with others is inherently stress inducing because
you're living with someone who you might not be compatible with.
Because everyone grows up differently and has
different perspectives, lifestyle differences are
guaranteed. As a roommate, you have to learn to tolerate
all their habits that annoy you daily.

Had I lived alone, I would have removed the
large source of stress living with others entails.
Yet, I probably would have signed myself up
for a year of loneliness and general unhappiness.
Knowing myself, if I had a nice cozy clean and quiet place,
I would just stay in my apartment and keep to myself.
I would remove everything that could possibly cause me any stress
and discomfort and operate well within the boundaries of my comfort zone.
But removing all potentially uncomfortable situations is a recipe
for disaster. It limits ones ability and openness to experiencing new things.
Without my roommates, I simply would have been a hermit with little to no social life.

Instead, by having roommates, I inevitably found myself
in situations I found somewhat discomforting at first.
At times, they would blast EDM, a genre of music I found distasteful
initially, for hours on end in the living room. Other times, they
hosted parties with a bunch of people I didn't know.
Sometimes, they dragged me to go workout with them in the gym.
In other words, they simply pushed me out of my comfort zone and got me
to try new things.

As a result of getting pushed out of my comfort zone,
here's some stuff I got to do within the year:
- Worked out consistently and got in better shape[^2]
- Went to bars / clubs / parties / raves
- Met a lot of fun people I wouldn't have otherwise
- Took a trip to the ER on Halloween

While it does suck to have to deal with the unpleasantries that comes
from living with others at times, (like having to clean up after parties),
deciding to room with others has truly been the biggest blessing in disguise.
Experiencing new situations this year has helped me see other perspectives in life.
and has significantly improved my social life. Trying new things is hard
and uneasy at first, but it has definitely made me happier over this past year.

I still prefer to stay in and study on the weekends rather
than go chill at a bar, club, or ER room, despite my roommates'
~~terrible~~ influence on me to try new things.
I still consider myself the same computer science nerd that I always was.
It's just this time, I'm a computer science nerd who has
gotten to experience things I might not have otherwise.

Ok, well if you dug this far, then you'll get the full rant

Pre rant notice:
These are only the negatives, and humans love focusing
on the negatives and forgetting about the positives. I do get fucking
annoyed sometimes, but I never forget about the positives.
Like I said before, I absolutely love
my roommates, and love living with them and would make the same
decision living with them with no hesitation.
That said, no matter what, I have to live alone after I graduate LOL
Living with 4 other roommates is a one and done for me xd

Back to the rant:
Ok, I swear these are all things I notice, but I NEVER actually
rage or get too hung up on it for too long.
My view is that we just have very different standards,
and sometimes it is just me being nit picky.
Some habits are really annoying (like the moldy fridge food)
but ultimately don't matter in the grand scheme of things and definitely
don't warrant a blowup.

Like I said before, we're all unique individuals with extremely different
perspectives who grew up separately with a bunch of varying backgrounds.
It's unreasonable to expect anyone to adapt to my living
standards just because I find it annoying. I've just come to accept
that we all have different perspectives and practices.

And besides, these are all from my perspective. I'm sure some of my
roommates find some of my habits annoying af. Though I can't imagine
what obviously :P

Anyways, here's the rant, guys are gross:

- The forks/spoons often times have hardened chunks of food still stuck on
  from not careful washing. I usually keep one spoon that I washed myself
  in my room so I don't have to look through the dishwasher to find a clean one.
  Sometimes it's a lottery I swear LOL, gross I know
- Usually I'm the only one who ever takes out the trash, otherwise there's
  usually a mini game of how high the shared trash can go before I take it out
  Eventually it gets so bad that when I try to take the trash out, there's
  always some trash that falls when you try to remove the trash can lid.
  Don't even get me started on the smell too..
- I'm pretty sure our apartment would've caught fire by now because
  I'm one of the only one who takes the lint out of the dryer
- This one actually makes me feel a little upset, but sometimes when I give up
  and don't clean, a MUTUAL FRIEND WHO DOESN'T LIVE AT THE APARTMENT,
  comes over and CLEANS UP FOR US like ?????? bruh.... I always
  feel so embarrassed from the laziness sometimes
- My roommate never cleans his bathroom. His toothbrush is like crusted over
  to the point where even he doesn't use it. He has the red rings of bacteria
  in his sink, toilet, and shower.
  You know who you are. If you're reading this,
  most of our friends roast you about this... <3
- People leave trash on the counter top ALL the time and don't clean
  up after themselves. They'll leave takeout containers out even after
  eating all the food.... Like ????, why not toss it out once you finish
  Instead, I'll go through and clean the counter top once it gets bad
  Gum wrappers, empty milk cartons, empty containers, plastic bags, empty
  soda cans, used silverware, you name it, it's been left out on counter
  for someone else (usually me) to clean.
- No one sweeps / swiffers the place apart from me. To put this in perspective
  we ordered 2 karaoke machines before we even ordered a broom!?
  The prioritization actually has me dead. Partying is #1
- There's always something in the fridge that's gonna go moldy. I'm
  of the type that knows exactly what I have in the fridge. But my roommates
  will leave leftovers and forget about it
  Usually once opening the fridge starts getting gag inducing,
  I'll go through and toss the moldy offender... so bad LOL
- There's always dishes in the sink that no one wants to wash. Eventually
  I cave and just do it when it gets bad smh
- Having to clean up after a party by yourself is ass.
- Having to put in earplugs to try to sleep despite karaoke
  echoing throughout the apartment during finals week is pretty tilting.
