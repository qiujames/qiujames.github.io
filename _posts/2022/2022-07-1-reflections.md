Just graduated! :tada: :confetti_ball:

It really quite hit me yet since nothing in life
has particularly changed in any way. Lecture and school work
has just been replaced with ... well nothing at the moment.[^1]

Anyways, having recently graduated from the University of Washington,
I've been doing some reflecting upon my college experience as a whole
and I thought I'd jot down a couple of thoughts and ideas that have
stuck with me.

#### College is Different for Everyone
Everyone makes different choices in college and those decisions
play a large role in how you develop as a person.
As a result of this, everyone will have vastly different
perspectives, experiences, and approaches to life.

Some might tell you to study hard and set yourself up for future success. 
Others might tell you to socialize, party, and meet new people.
Then you have my ex who'll say you should cheat while you're young.
What you do in college really is up to you.

#### Grades Don't Matter
Turns out no one gives a f*** about your grades once you graduate.
From personal experience (maybe I'm just jaded), I feel as though
the culture in college tends to prioritize grades over learning.
Instead of obsessing over GPA, learn for the sake of learning,
and more importantly spend time doing stupid shit outside of academics
with your friends with the short 4 years you have.


#### Everything will be OK
There's lots of factors in life that we can't control. We can't 
control the situations we end up in, or who we end up meeting. Thing's 
sometimes can feel like they're going south at times but it's funny how
things have a way of turning out well. With the right mindset and effort,
it's only a matter of time before things end up working out.

## That's a Wrap!
Well, I guess it's finally to enter a new stage of life
now that my time as a student has finally ended. I guess
the only fitting way to end this post is with a a photo dump.
It wouldn't be a graduation post without one after all :sunglasses:.

[^1]: I wish I was exaggerating, but I have literally no responsibilites or obligations this summer apart from the occasional birthday celebration. No internship, no work, no girlfriend. Life seriously couldn't be any simpler. It's honestly quite refreshing having no stress for once in my life. At the same time, sitting on my ass all day is slowly killing me with boredom. We'll see what happens once I start work in August.
