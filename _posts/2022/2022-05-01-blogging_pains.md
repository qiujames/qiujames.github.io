title: "Blogging Pains"
---
So it turns out I struggle with consistently publishing blog posts
as evidenced by my sporadic posting schedule.

My biggest problem is that I am extremely nit picky.
Every sentence has to
be passable (they have to make grammatical sense, can't sound too awkward, have to start with
a variety of different words etc).
Turning a general idea in my head and forming reasonable sentences and putting them down in text takes a lot more time than I expected.
I know this is a casual blog, but I
still care about writing at a decent level.

And sometimes even when I do finally write everything
I'll read it over and find that the flow of the content is all over the place. I'll find that it lacks cohesiveness and focus and then I'll completely scrap it and never publish it.
In other words, I ramble a lot.

Looking back at my first couple of blog posts I find them
pretty disorganized and kind of pointless(?) even though I
do think the original topic they're trying to discuss is worthy of a post.
To be fair, I did mention in the first blog post that my
writings in the start would probably be shit so I should
get some credit for predicting that at least.
Oh well, it's a learning experience.

To address this, I'll try to focus on keeping things short.
By writing fewer words, I can avoid rambling and keep
things focused. More importantly, I'm going to
force myself to be ok with imperfections. My previous
attempts at being "perfect" were already pretty bad so
I'm ok with writing imperfectly :laughing:.
