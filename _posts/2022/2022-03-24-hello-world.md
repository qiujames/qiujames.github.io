title: "Hello World!"
---

Welcome to my blog! In the spirit of computer science tradition,
it's only fitting to kick it off with a "Hello World" titled post.

## Blog Beginnings
I started this website / blog over my senior year spring break
thinking it would be nice to create and maintain something from scratch.
Plus, I had a personal website I had created from my freshman year that
*really* needed to be updated in terms of content and presentation.
It was really ugly. This is much better :grinning:.

This also serves as a place where I get to write about technical topics
in computer science, maintain a list of projects I'm proud of,
and remember some of the more interesting moments in life.
There is no planned content really.
Just things I find interesting and worthwhile to write about.

Also a blog helps build a habit of writing.
I've always struggled with communicating complex ideas
effectively and it's been something I've wanted to improve upon.
Writing more should help with that.
Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking and you learn how to write by writing.
Better to start now than never.[^1]

Your 1st meditation will be scattered, but your 1000th will be focused.
Put in your reps.
