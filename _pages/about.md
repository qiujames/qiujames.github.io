Hi! Welcome to my small corner on the internet!

I graduated from the the University of Washington with a bachelors
in computer science in 2022. 

Since graduating, I've been currently working fulltime at [Stripe][stripe]
I currently work in Security where I work on keeping customer data safe
while doing my best to avoid taking down Stripe on my birthday (yes this really happened).

I've previously interned at ~~Facebook~~ Meta, Optiver, and Amazon, where
I've been able to work on some pretty neat stuff (merge conflict
resolution tooling, asynchronous task scheduling, combing through
logs of hardware test failures, etc).

Nowadays, you can find me playing volleyball with friends,
outdoors running or playing pickleball, and still wearing
those free company t-shirts. I also maintain this blog from
time to time.

Feel free to reach out if you want to add me on Strava
or if you want a detailed 9 step skincare routine for morning and nighttime.
